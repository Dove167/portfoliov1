## Introduction

Joshua Fajardo is a resilient and determined Full Stack Web Developer currently in his final term at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). His journey to tech is a testament to perseverance, having overcome significant challenges and transformed his career path through dedication and hard work. Known among his peers as the "Phoenix Developer" for his ability to rise from setbacks and rebuild stronger, Josh brings a unique blend of technical expertise, creative problem-solving, and emotional intelligence to his work.

## Early Life and Background

Josh's story begins far from the tech industry. His early career included years of diverse work experiences that shaped his character and work ethic:

- **Shoppers Drug Mart (2016-2020)**: Starting as a cashier and stock clerk, Josh developed strong customer service skills and learned the importance of attention to detail in managing inventory and transactions.
- **Dometic (2020-2022)**: Working as a production worker fabricating boat components, he honed his problem-solving abilities and learned to exceed daily quotas through efficiency and innovation.
- **Cancork Floors (2022-2023)**: As a customer service representative, Josh enhanced product visibility to increase sales and managed shipping logistics using FedEx and Excel.

These experiences, while seemingly unrelated to technology, instilled in Josh the resilience, communication skills, and practical problem-solving abilities that would later become invaluable in his tech career.

## Educational Journey

Josh's path to BCIT was not straightforward. After struggling in his first attempt at post-secondary education, he made the courageous decision to return to adult school. His dedication paid off with impressive academic achievements:

- **90% in English 12**
- **81% in Precalculus 12**

These accomplishments opened the door to BCIT, where he discovered his passion for building user-centric web applications. Now in his final term of the Full Stack Web Development diploma program, Josh is set to graduate in late April 2026.
